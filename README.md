# Triple_Pendulum

The main goal of this project is to simulate the behaviour of a triple pendulum. To numerically integrate the equation of motions for such a system the RungeKutta 4 iterative method is used. Moreover, the angular positions have been computed considering three slightly different initial configurations in order to show how the solutions for such cpmplex equations of motion may easily diverge.

A script to create a gif using Gnuplot from a text file containing the angular positions at different times is reported, together with the main C++ script.
